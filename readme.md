To initialize the database, a database has to be exists.
The name and the password of the database should be entered in the db.js file.

I kept my values in order to make it work the API.

\*\* In the requests which will be made from POSTMAN, all of the IDs are UUIDs.
After creating the server, the IDs has to be taken from the Users table.
The IDs in the POSTMAN collection wont be valid because each time UUID gives different IDs.
